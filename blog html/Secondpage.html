                                            <p>As a quality assurance tester at a video games company in 2006, we were paid an hourly rate consistent with California minimum wage, plus overtime. One day, HR mixed up our paychecks and I ended up with one belonging to a white guy. His base was a fat $2 more than my pitiful California state minimum wage. We worked there the same length of time, had the same role, pulled the same overtime—we were even the same age. I asked HR about it, and about a month later, my contract was terminated (ostensibly for unrelated reasons). Not that I’m bitter; that guy still works in QA 10 years later, and he makes considerably less than me.</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                              <p>Later, when I worked at a large tech company, I was frequently told that my communication style was aggressive, bossy, and confrontational. This was usually told to me by male superiors or peers. These same people often interrupted me when I was speaking, stood up to walk around me where I was seated (as if I were in a police interrogation), and one of them actually would sneak up behind me on my way into the bathroom and slam a basketball on the floor directly behind me to “scare” me as a “joke.”</p>

                                                    Didn’t even bother with HR this time; I just left that company for another one.</p>

                                                    <p>Go to the networking events, even if you don’t think of yourself as a “woman in tech.” You’re not going to break in being picky about labels. Look for relevant conferences that hire volunteer staffers and apply to be one. It’s a great way to network and get free access to the content.</p>     
                                                    
                                                     <p>Make friends.</p>
                                                    
                                                     <p>Do not be the poor sucker who always takes notes in meetings or gets coffee for people. Unless your actual job is “secretary” or “caterer,” in which case, carry on.</p>
                                                     
                                                     <p>Ban the phrase “I’m sorry,” from your vocabulary at work. If you actually need to apologize for something, use the words “I apologize,” instead.</p>
                                                <p>Seriously. Make friends. Whether you’re just starting out or have been in it a long time, you’ll never get through the hard days without friends.</p>

                                    <p>To the best of my knowledge, I think I’m one of the rare ones in infosec where I have not encountered any biases because of my gender. That isn’t to say that there are no biases—it’s just that they’re fueled by other reasons that don’t include me being a woman. In my first eight years in the infosec industry, I was based in the Philippines, and we have a lot of female reverse engineers, spam and fraud experts, and technical writers. I’ve also served under a number of female managers and executives.

                                            Did I come across sexism as a public figure? I don’t think so—unless we count the times I’m referred to as “he” by press people in my quotes, which happened (and continues to happen) most of the time. I guess that goes to show that not many women in infosec are covered in the media. I’d like to see a change in this.</p>
                                  
                                           <h4>Advice for women in tech</h4>
It may seem like I’m sheltered from the gender issues many women in tech in the US experience, and you’re probably right…although I do sympathize deeply. But one thing I can share is that if women ever wonder if it’s even possible to work in infosec and not feel unwelcome or unheard because of their gender—I can say that it is. And being part of a company that lets you do what you do best, helps you grow in your career, and doesn’t discriminate because of your gender is a very, very fulfilling experience. My takeaways from those years continue to serve me until today.

And on this International Women’s Day, we wanted to do more than pay lip service to the changes in feminist dialogue. After all, tech is an industry with a well-deserved reputation for being a boy’s club. But that’s something that needs to change.</p>
